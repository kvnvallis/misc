# Odds and ends

Experiments, coding challenges, and anything else.

## fixlinks.sh

Small posix script meant to be used with `find -exec` to fix symlinks where target files or folders have moved to a new location. Preserves symlink filenames and parent folders of the symlink targets. 

## autoip.py

Autocompletes ip addresses for the subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, using a recursive function that counts by concatenating numerical strings. 

## avi2dvd.sh

Specifically created for converting the standard definition theatrical cut of *Return of the Jedi* into a dvd, but applicable to other transcodes with some modification.

## mkdvd.sh

Just make an iso of a dvd filesystem and burn it for playback on a home dvd player.

## webview.sh

Look at markdown files rendered in your web browser.
